## Preamble

Presented here is the code, data and (updated) results for the paper:

Matthews, T.J. & Aspin, T.W.H. (2019) Model averaging fails to improve the
extrapolation capability of the island species–area relationship. Journal of
Biogeography, 46, 1558–1568.

For the study aim and methods, see the original paper.

Through subsequent analyses and data checking, we have corrected small data
entry errors where they have been found. In a small number of cases, we have
subsequently found that the source paper authors published updated / more
extensive versions of the datasets used; in these cases, we have replaced
the original version. As such, the datasets presented here differ slightly
from those used in the original publication. In addition, since the paper
was published in 2019, there have been numerous updated made to the 'sars'
R package, including replacing models, bug fixes and improving the fitting algorithms.
As such, the results presented here may differ slightly from those published
in the original paper, although the main conclusions are unchanged. 

One thing we changed in the code relates to how the power model checks are done. Originally we ran these checks 
(e.g. residual normality, z-value significance) on the full dataset rather than the filtered dataset used to predict the richness of the largest islands. In hindsight, it arguably makes
more sense to check the power model residual assumptions using
the filtered dataset. As such, we run this sensitivity test using
the filtered datasets (th = 0.5).

The R script and source code are stored in the 'R code' directory. The datasets
are stored in a list called 'Datasets' (saved in the drive "Data" within the
repository), where each element is a dataframe (representing a dataset) with two
columns: area (a) and number of species (s). Area is in ha. Dataset numbers
match the filenames in the 'filenames.rds' file. The "Data" directory also holds
a csv file called "preds" which contains the taxon and latitude data for each study,
which is used in the GAM analyses. Finally, there is a word document which provides
meta-data for each of the sourced datasets.

## Results

### POW vs. MMI

When a th value of 0.5 was used, the power model provided the best fit to the
most (filtered) datasets (n = 24), followed by the linear model (n = 21), and
then the negative exponential (n = 17), logarithmic (n = 17) and Monod (n = 15)
models, according to AICc.

For one dataset, no models could be successfully fitted (i.e. no models passed
the residual assumption tests) and this dataset was removed from the
comparisons. In contrast with our hypothesis, the power model provided the most
accurate prediction of the richness of the largest island (i.e. the lowest
absolute LEE value) in 67 cases (56%), with the multi‐model averaged curve
providing the more accurate prediction in the remaining 52 cases (44%). The
median LEE value of the power model was 0.04 (95% quantiles = −0.30 and 0.31),
whilst the median LEE value of the multi‐model curve (LEE‐MMI) was 0.02 (95%
quantiles = −0.34 and 1.56). However, as LEE values could be both positive and
negative, the median of the absolute LEE values provides a better summary of the
extrapolation capability: the median of absolute LEE‐POW values was 0.08 (95%
quantiles = 0.01 and 0.35), whilst the median of absolute LEE‐MMI values was
0.10 (95% quantiles = 0.002 and 1.56). Both the power model (64% of LEE‐POW
values were positive) and the multi‐model averaged curve (57% of LEE‐MMI values
were positive) had a slightly greater tendency to over predict the observed
richness.

The confidence intervals were on average narrower for the
power model predictions (median 95% confidence interval width = 18) than for the
multi‐model averaged curve predictions (median 95% confidence interval width =
125). The confidence intervals around the multi‐model
averaged curve predictions were sometimes very large. 


### Predictions from 20 individual models

When the extrapolation predictions from all 20 ISAR models were considered, in addition to the multi‐model averaged curve, the power model provided the most accurate prediction of the richness of the largest island in 10 cases, with the multi‐model averaged curve providing the most accurate prediction in nine cases. The negative exponential model provided the best prediction the most times, with 12 cases (the results for all models are provided in Table 1), with the Extended Power 2 model providing the best prediction in 8 cases. 

### GAMs

The full GAM (i.e. the GAM with all predictors) had a lower AIC value (−114.5)
than an equivalent standard linear regression model (−112.7); this provides
additional justification for our use of GAMs. When LEE‐POW was used as the
response variable in a GAM model selection analysis, the best model(s) contained
Ascale, Sscale, Lat. and Smin (Table 2). In the published analysis, these four
variables were all in the best model, whereas now, while they were all included
in the models with delta AICc <=2, the best model only contained Ascale and
Sscale. A plot of the smoothers for these four Variables, when all fitted in the
same model, is provided as Figure 2. The effective degrees of freedom of the
smoothers for Ascale and Lat. were one, indicating that these smoothers were
straight lines; increasing Ascale resulted in decreasing LEE‐POW, while the
opposite pattern was true for Lat (Figure 2). A difference with the published
results was that the effective degrees of freedom of the smoothers for Sscale
was now also linear, although the general pattern was the same (increasing
Sscale resulted in an increase in LEE‐POW). The Smin relationship was still more
complex (Figure 2). However, there was a reasonable degree of model uncertainty
as the best model had an AICc weight of only 0.16, and there were three
additional models within 2 delta AICc units of the best model (Table 2). In
addition, the adjusted R2 value of the model with all four of the aforementioned
variables was low (0.15). Ascale (0.98), Sscale (0.99) had quite high relative
importance values, whilst the values for the remaining predictors were all lower
(Table 2).
 

For 18 of the ISAR models, the relative fit of a model to the filtered dataset
(i.e. the model's AICc weight) was a poor predictor of a model's extrapolation
accuracy (measured using the LEE metric). In only two cases (for the logistic
and Extended Power 1 models) was the AICc weight a significant predictor of a
model's absolute LEE value.



### Sensitivity analyses

The choice of th value did not change the overall qualitative results. The power
model provided the more accurate prediction in 66 (55%) and 66 (56%; when a th
value of 0.7 was used there were three datasets for which no models could be
successfully fitted) cases when th values of 0.3 and 0.7 were used,
respectively.  In regards to the power model validation sensitivity test, there
were 55 datasets (up from 23 in the published analyses) for which the power
model failed one of the validation checks. The difference is due to us now
running the checks using the filtered datasets rather than full datasets. Most
of these failed checks are a result of non-significant z-values. If this check
is removed, only 19 datasets fail the validation checks (i.e. the residual
assumption checks). When removing these 55 datasets and re‐running the
prediction analysis using the remaining 65 datasets, the power model still
provided the most best-fits to the filtered datasets (18 vs. 10 for the
logarithmic in second place). The power model provided the most accurate
prediction of the richness of the largest island (i.e. the lowest absolute LEE
value) in 46% of cases, with the multi‐model averaged curve providing the more
accurate prediction in 54% of cases. This differed slightly from the main
results, where the power model provided the most accurate prediction the
majority of times. However, the relative performance is still roughly 50:50 and
thus the main conclusions are unchanged. If the validation sensitivity test is
instead run using the full dataset, as in the original published paper, the
qualitative results are unchanged: the power model provided the best prediction
in 54% of cases compared to 46% for the multi-model averaged curve.  Finally,
rerunning the prediction analysis after excluding the linear model from the
multi‐model averaged curve resulted in a slight increase in the number of cases
where the multi‐model averaged curve provided the more accurate prediction (55
cases), but the general picture remained the same.


#### Table 1

TABLE 1 The 20 models that were fitted to generate the multi‐model averaged ISAR
curve. Mean weight is the mean AICc weight for a given model across all fits to
the filtered datasets (excluding non‐satisfactory fits). Best fit corresponds
the number of times a model provided the best fit to a filtered dataset. Best
prediction corresponds to the number of times a model provided the best
extrapolated prediction in the all model comparison.

FIGURE 1 The varying species richness predictions of five ISAR models. Each of the
five models (see Table 1) was fitted to a simulated archipelago consisting of
eight islands of varying size (1, 3, 7, 14, 17, 22, 26 and 30; undefined units)
and richness (3, 7, 14, 18, 20, 23, 24 and 25). These model fits were then used
to predict the richness of an island of size 80 (grey dotted line)

FIGURE 2 Fitted smoothers from a generalized additive model showing the partial effects of Ascale, Latitude, Smin and Sscale on
the LEE‐POW values. The fitted values have been shifted in each plot by adding the model intercept (0.04) value (using the shift argument
in the plot.gam R function). The effective degrees of freedom for each smoother are: Ascale (1.00), Latitude (1.00), Smin (2.90) and Sscale (1.00).
The dashed lines represent the standard error curves (two SE above and below). Each LEE‐POW value relates to the accuracy of a prediction
of the number of species on a habitat island using the power model. For each of 119 habitat island datasets, the largest island and all islands
larger than half the size of the largest island were removed and the power model was fitted to the filtered dataset and extrapolated.
